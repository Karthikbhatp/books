After a timer has been terminated, its execution thread terminates gracefully and no more timer tasks may be scheduled on it. (Calling cancel() from within the run() method of a timer task that was invoked by this timer absolutely guarantees that the ongoing task execution is the last task execution that will ever be performed by this timer.) This method may be called repeatedly; the second and subsequent calls have no effect.\n",
    "* __int purge():__ Remove all canceled timer tasks from this timer’s queue and return the number of timer tasks that have been removed. Calling purge() has no effect on the behavior of the timer, but eliminates references to the canceled timer tasks from the queue. When there are no external references to these timer tasks, they become eligible for garbage collection. (Most applications won’t need to call this method, which is designed for use by the rare application that cancels a large number of timer tasks. Calling purge() trades time for space: this method’s runtime may be proportional to n + c * log n, where n is the number of timer tasks in the queue and c is the number of canceled timer tasks.) It’s permissible to call purge() from within a timer task scheduled on this timer.\n",
    "* __void schedule(TimerTask task, Date time):__ Schedule task for execution at time. When time is in the past, task is scheduled for immediate execution. This method throws java.lang. IllegalArgumentException when time.getTime() is negative; java.lang.IllegalStateException when task was already scheduled or canceled, the timer was canceled, or the task- execution thread terminated; and NullPointerException when task or time is null.\n",
    "* __void schedule(TimerTask task, Date firstTime, long period):__ Schedule task for repeated fixed-delay execution, beginning at firstTime. Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals, separated by period milliseconds. In fixed-delay execution, each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution. When an execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection), subsequent executions are also delayed. In the long run, the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of period (assuming the system clock underlying Object.wait(long) is accurate). As a consequence, when the scheduled firstTime value is in the past, task is scheduled for immediate execution. Fixed-delay execution is appropriate for recurring tasks that require “smoothness.” In other words, this form of execution is appropriate for tasks where it’s more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run. This includes most animation tasks, such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals. It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input, such as automatically repeating a character for as long as a key is held down. This method throws IllegalArgumentException when firstTime.getTime() is negative or period is negative or zero; IllegalStateException when task was already scheduled or canceled, the timer was canceled, or the task-execution thread terminated; and NullPointerException when task or firstTime is null.\n",
    "* __void schedule(TimerTask task, long delay):__ Schedule task for execution after delay milliseconds. This method throws IllegalArgumentException when delay is negative or delay + System.currentTimeMillis() is negative; IllegalStateException when task was already scheduled or canceled, the timer was canceled, or the task-execution thread terminated; and NullPointerException when task is null.\n",
    "* __void schedule(TimerTask task, long delay, long period):__ Schedule task for repeated fixed-delay execution, beginning after delay milliseconds. Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals separated by period milliseconds. This method throws IllegalArgumentException when delay is negative, delay + System.currentTimeMillis() is negative, or period is negative or zero; IllegalStateException when task was already scheduled or canceled, the timer was canceled, or the task-execution thread terminated; and NullPointerException when task is null.\n",
    "* __void scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, Date firstTime, long period):__ Schedule task for repeated fixed- rate execution, beginning at time. Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals, separated by period milliseconds. In fixed-rate execution, each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution. When an execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection), two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to “catch up.” In the long run, the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of period (assuming the system clock underlying Object.wait(long) is accurate). As a consequence, when the scheduled firstTime is in the past, any “missed” executions will be scheduled for immediate “catch up” execution. Fixed-rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to absolute time (such as ringing a chime every hour on the hour, or running scheduled maintenance every day at a particular time). It’s also appropriate for recurring activities where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important, such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for 10 seconds. Finally, fixed-rate execution is appropriate for scheduling multiple repeating timer tasks that must remain synchronized with respect to one another. This method throws IllegalArgumentException when firstTime.getTime() is negative, or period is negative or zero; IllegalStateException when task was already scheduled or canceled, the timer was canceled, or the task-execution thread terminated; and NullPointerException when task or firstTime is null.\n",
    "* __void scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, long delay, long period):__ Schedule task for repeated fixed-rate execution, beginning after delay milliseconds.

For example, you would specify code similar to if (System.currentTimeMillis() -scheduledExecutionTime() >= MAX_TARDINESS) return;at the start of the run() method to abort the current timer task execution when it’s not timely. This method is typically not used in conjunction with fixed-delay execution repeating timer tasks because their scheduled execution times are allowed to drift over time and are thus not terribly significant. scheduledExecutionTime() returns the time at which the most recent execution of this timer task was scheduled to occur, in the format returned by java.util.Date.getTime().

    "The ThreadGroup class describes a thread group, which stores a set of threads. It simplifies thread management by applying method calls to all contained threads. You should avoid using thread groups because the most useful methods are deprecated and because of a race condition.\n",
    "\n",

It provides a separate storage slot to each thread that accesses the variable. Think of a thread-local variable as a multislot variable in which each thread can store a different value in the same variable. Each thread sees only its value and is unaware of other threads having their own values in this variable. Values stored in thread-local variables are not related. A parent thread can use the InheritableThreadLocal class to pass a value to a child thread.\n",
