    "* __Condition newCondition():__ Return a new Condition instance that’s bound to this Lock instance. This method throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException when the Lock implementation class doesn’t support conditions.\n",
    "* __boolean tryLock():__ Acquire the lock when it’s available at the time this method is invoked. The method returns true when the lock is acquired and false when the lock isn’t acquired.\n",
