    "### Summary\n",
    "Developing multithreaded applications is much easier when threads don’t interact, typically via shared variables. When interaction occurs, race conditions, data races, and cached variable problems can arise that make an application thread-unsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use synchronization to solve race conditions, data races, and cached variable problems. Synchronization is a JVM feature that ensures that two or more concurrent threads don’t simultaneously execute a critical section that must be accessed in a serial manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liveness refers to something beneficial happening eventually. A liveness failure occurs when an application reaches a state in which it can make no further progress. Multithreaded applications face the liveness challenges of deadlock, livelock, and starvation.\n",
    "Synchronization exhibits two properties: mutual exclusion and visibility. The synchronized keyword is associated with both properties. Java also provides a weaker form of synchronization involving visibility only, and associates only this property with the volatile keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a field variable is declared volatile, it cannot also be declared final. However, this isn’t a problem because Java also lets you safely access a final field without the need for synchronization. You will often use final to help ensure thread safety in the context of an immutable class.\n",
