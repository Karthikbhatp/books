    "Java supports concurrency via its low-level threading features and higher-level concurrency utilities such as thread pools. The problem with concurrency is that it doesn’t maximize the use of available processor/core resources. For example, suppose you’ve created a sorting algorithm that divides an array into two halves, assigns two threads to sort each half, and merges the results after both threads finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that each thread runs on a different processor. Because different amounts of element reordering may occur in each half of the array, it’s possible that one thread will finish before the other thread and must wait before the merge can happen. In this case, a processor resource is wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem (and the related problems of the code being verbose and harder to read) can be solved by recursively breaking a task into subtasks and combining results. These subtasks run in parallel and complete approximately at the same time (if not at the same moment), where their results are merged and passed up the stack to the previous layer of subtasks. Hardly any processor time is wasted through waiting, and the recursive code is less verbose and (usually) easier to understand. Java provides the Fork/Join Framework to implement this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fork/Join consists of a special executor service and thread pool. The executor service makes a task available to the framework, and this task is broken into smaller tasks that are forked (executed by different threads) from the pool. A task waits until joined (its subtasks finish).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fork/Join uses work stealing to minimize thread contention and overhead. Each worker thread from a pool of worker threads has its own double-ended work queue and pushes new tasks to this queue. It reads the task from the head of the queue. If the queue is empty, the worker thread tries to get a task from the tail of another queue. Stealing is infrequent because worker threads put tasks into their queues in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, and the size of work items gets smaller as a problem is divided into subproblems. You start by giving the tasks to a central worker and it keeps dividing them into smaller tasks. Eventually all of the workers have something to do with minimal synchronization."
