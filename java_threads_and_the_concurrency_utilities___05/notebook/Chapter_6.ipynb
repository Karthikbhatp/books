    "## Summary\n",
    "Java provides the synchronized keyword for synchronizing thread access to critical sections. Because it can be difficult to correctly write synchronized code that’s based on synchronized, high-level synchronizers are included in the concurrency utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __countdown latch__ causes one or more threads to wait at a “gate” until another thread opens this gate, at which point these other threads can continue. It consists of a count and operations for “causing a thread to wait until the count reaches zero” and “decrementing the count.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A __cyclic barrier__ lets a set of threads wait for each other to reach a common barrier point. The barrier is cyclic because it can be reused after the waiting threads are released. This synchronizer is useful in applications involving a fixed-size party of threads that must occasionally wait for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __exchanger__ provides a synchronization point where threads can swap objects. Each thread presents some object on entry to the exchanger’s exchange() method, matches with a partner thread, and receives its partner’s object on return.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __semaphore__ maintains a set of permits for restricting the number of threads that can access a limited resource. A thread attempting to acquire a permit when no permits are available blocks until some other thread releases a permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __phaser__ is a more flexible cyclic barrier. Like a cyclic barrier, a phaser lets a group of threads wait on a barrier; these threads continue after the last thread arrives. A phaser also offers the equivalent of a barrier action. Unlike a cyclic barrier, which coordinates a fixed number of threads, a phaser can coordinate a variable number of threads, which can register at any time. To implement this capability, a phaser uses phases and phase numbers.\n",
