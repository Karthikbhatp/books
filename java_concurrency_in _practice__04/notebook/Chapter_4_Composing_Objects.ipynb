Again, the answer depends on what invariants your class imposes on those variables. While the underlying value field in Counter could take on any integer value, Counter constrains it to take on only positive values, and the increment operation constrains the set of valid next states given any current state. If you were to make the value field public, clients could change it to an invalid value, so publishing it would render the class incorrect. On the other hand, if a variable represents the current temperature or the ID of the last user to log on, then having another class modify this value at any time probably would not violate any invariants, so publishing this variable might be acceptable. (It still may not be a good idea, since publishing mutable variables constrains future development and opportunities for subclassing, but it would not necessarily render the class not thread-safe.)"

    "Documentation is one of the most powerful (and, sadly, most underutilized) tools for managing thread safety. Users look to the documentation to find out if a class is thread-safe, and maintainers look to the documentation to understand the implementation strategy so they can maintain it without inadvertently com- promising safety. Unfortunately, both of these constituencies usually find less information in the documentation than they’d like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document a class’s thread safety guarantees for its clients; document its synchronization policy for its maintainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the best time to document design decisions is at design time. Weeks or months later, the details may be a blur—so write it down before you forget.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least, document the thread safety guarantees made by a class. Is it thread-safe? Does it make callbacks with a lock held? Are there any specific locks that affect its behavior? Don’t force clients to make risky guesses. If you don’t want to commit to supporting client-side locking, that’s fine, but say so. If you want clients to be able to create new atomic operations on your class, as we did in Section 4.4, you need to document which locks they should acquire to do so safely. If you use locks to guard state, document this for future maintainers, because it’s so easy—the @GuardedBy annotation will do the trick. If you use more subtle means to maintain thread safety, document them because they may not be obvious to maintainers.\n",

    "### Interpreting vague documentation\n",
    "Servlets are always called from a container-managed thread, and it is safe to assume that if there is more than one such thread, the container knows this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the servlet container should expect to have these objects accessed concurrently, since it has created multiple threads and called methods like Servlet.service from them that could reasonably be expected to access the ServletContext.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataSource provides ser- vice to an application, and it doesn’t make much sense in the context of a single- threaded application. It is hard to imagine a use case that doesn’t involve calling getConnection from multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even though the specification doesn’t promise that DataSource is thread-safe or require container vendors to provide a thread-safe implementation, by the same “it would be absurd if it weren’t” argu- ment, we have no choice but to assume that DataSource.getConnection does not require additional client-side locking.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if an activity that obtains a JDBC Connection spans multiple threads, it must take responsibility for ensuring that access to the Connection is properly guarded by synchronization."
